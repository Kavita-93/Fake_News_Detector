# Fake_News_Detector

**Introduction**

This repository contains a project for fake news detection using traditional machine learning techniques. The workflow includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, data analysis, and training classification models to identify fake news. The system is designed to classify news articles as either real or fake purely based on their textual content.

**Problem Definition**
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning system to detect fake news from the content of news articles. The model will analyze the text of individual articles and classify each one as real or fake based on patterns learned from a labeled dataset. By accurately identifying fake news at the article level, the system can help reduce the spread of misinformation and improve the reliability of information consumed by users.
The intended application of this project is for social media platforms or news aggregators, where the modelâ€™s predictions can be used to flag or reduce the visibility of articles that are likely to be fake. This approach ensures that users are exposed to more trustworthy content and helps in combating the circulation of false information online.
